The first command on my script is IP a command. The IP stands for Internet Protocol. It is like the ifconfig command. 
Ip shows a lot of information about the routing, devices, and tunnels.  Ip has too many options such as the IP route show which displays the system default route. 
In my script, I picked the IP a option to get information on all the network interfaces on the system.  

A second is the Netstat command. Netstat command is used to show network status and routing table. Netstat can be run by using different options. 
I choose the netstat -a option to be on my script because it shows detailed information for active connections by listing all ports both TCP and UDP. 

The third command is the Tcpdumb command which is a packet analyzer. It prints out network packets. It has many configuration options. 
I picked the tcpdump -D which lists all available interfaces. I choose this option because it is a great command to analyze network packets.

The fourth command is the dig command. The  Dig command is used to gather DNS information. It allows you to query information about DNS records such as host addresses,
mail exchanges, and server names. It is commonly used to troubleshoot a DNS. I choose this command because if help in diagnosing DNS issues and list information about DNS. 

The last command is the arp command. It stands for Address Resolution Protocol. The arp command is used to map IPV addresses to hardware addresses. 
It also identifies the systems to some extent. Arp can be used to display an arp cache for a specific IP address, and that is by typing arp -a and the IP address. 
In my script, I used the arp -a option to display the complete ARP cache.
