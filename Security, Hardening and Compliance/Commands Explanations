The Script Commands

Sudo free: using this command in the script provides information of the used memory and the free available memory. The command provided the information by dividing it into columns.
Total column numbers show the amount of memory that can be used by applications. The used column provides information about the used memory which is calculated as 
used = total – free – buffers-cache. Free columns stand for the unused available memory. The shared column can be ignored because it is only for backward compatibility. 
Buff/cache column is a combination of memory used by the kernel buffers and page cache and slabs. The available column is the amount of memory that is available for starting 
new applications.

Sudo mpstat: is to display the statistics of the CPU usage of the system by showing information about CPU utilization and performance. 

Sudo lsof: everything considers as a file in Linux, so it is important to maintain files. The lsof command gives a list of all visible and not visible opened files that are in use.

Sudo atop: is a great command that can be used to monitor system resources and display information related to system load at a process level. It also allows monitoring threads 
within processes. After running the script, the command information would be shown on the terminal. However, the output can be saved in a file if the users wish by answering yes 
for appending the commands outputs to a file called info.
