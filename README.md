 # Linux Adminstration Class
 
I consider all the labs I did in Linux administration class accomplishments. My favorite labs were Awk, Networking, and Firewall. Corp job labs were interesting. It was amazing to learn about all the things you can do to monitor a server. Learning about Splunk labs was a great opportunity an interesting experience.

1. Biggest Challenge: Keeping track of the class workload and learning objectives.

2. Moments I am most proud of are setting up my servers and being able to write scripts.

3. One thing I would do to improve is if I could do this all over again. I would take fewer courses to give more time to the Linux Administration class, because there was a lot to learn.

4. One thing from term I could see myself using in a job in the future is monitoring server health and installing programs.

5. Did I improve the thing(s) I set out to improve on since the midterm? Yes, I did by managing my time, turning in all my labs, and uploading more of my work on the GitHub page.
