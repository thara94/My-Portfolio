 # Accomplishments of Linux Adminstration Class
 
I consider all the labs I did in Linux administration class accomplishments. My favorite labs were Awk, Networking, and Firewall. Corp job labs were interesting. It was amazing to learn about all the things you can do to mentor a server. Learning about Splunk labs was a great opportunity and interesting experience.

2. Moment you were most proud of. Networking sript, and the corp server set up.

3. One thing you would do to improve if you could do this all over again. Take less courses to give more time to Linux Adminstration class, because there was alot to learn.

4. One thing from term you could see yourself using in a job in the future. Monitor server health.

5. Did you improve the thing(s) you set out to improve since the midterm? Yes, I did by managing my time and upload more of my work on the GitHub page.
