 # Accomplishments of Linux Adminstration Class
 
I consider all the labs I did in Linux administration class accomplishments. My favorite labs were Awk, Networking, and Firewall. Corp job labs were interesting. It was amazing to learn about all the things you can do to mentor a server. Learning about Splunk labs was a great opportunity and interesting experience.
